# image-caption-generator
Image captioning is the task of automatically generating a textual
description of an image. It is a challenging problem that requires both
visual and language understanding. In recent years, deep learning
techniques have been successfully applied to image captioning, leading
to significant improvements in the quality of generated captions.
I propose a deep learning approach for image
captioning. Our approach consists of two main components: an image
encoder and a language decoder. The image encoder is a convolutional
neural network (CNN) that is trained to extract visual features from the
input image. The language decoder is a long short-term memory (LSTM)
network that is trained to generate a caption for the image based on
the visual features extracted by the image encoder. We also introduce
an attention mechanism into the model, which allows the model to
selectively focus on different parts of the image while generating the
caption
Model architecture: Describe the overall architecture of the model,
including the image encoder (CNN), language decoder (LSTM), and
attention mechanism. You may want to include dia
